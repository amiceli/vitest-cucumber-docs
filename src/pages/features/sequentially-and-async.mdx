    # For async and await

    Steps can be asynchronous because they are executed sequentially.

    But `Scenario` and `ScenarioOutline` are not asynchronous.

    Depending on what you need to do you can use scenario hooks. 

    ## Steps are run sequentially

    Since v2.0.0 `vitest-cucumber` use `test.each` instead of `test`.
    To follow Gherkin way, steps are tested one after one.

    An example Scenario : 

    ~~~ts
    describeFeature(feature, ({ Scenario }) => {
        Scenario(`Run steps sequentially`, ({ Given, And, When, Then }) => {
            let count = 0
            Given(`Count equals 0`, () => {
                expect(count).toBe(0)
            })
            And(`I increase the count by 1 in a promise`, async () => {
                await new Promise((resolve) => {
                    count++
                    resolve(null)
                })
            })
            When(`I use a timeout to increase`, async () => {
                await new Promise((resolve) => {
                    setTimeout(() => {
                        count++
                        resolve(null)
                    }, 1000)
                })
            })
            Then(`At end count should be 2`, () => {
                expect(count).toBe(2)
            })
        })
    })
    ~~~
