    # Ignore Rule / Scenario with Gherkin tags

    `describeFeature` allow optionnal options to ignore `Scenario`, `Scenario Outline`, `Rule` according a tag.

    Gherkin example : 

    ~~~
    Feature: detect uncalled rules
        @awesome
        Scenario: Me I am executed
            Given vitest-cucumber is running
            Then I am executed
        @another-tag
        Rule: executed rule
            Scenario: I am also executed
                Given vitest-cucumber is running
                Then  my parent rule is called
            @custom
            Scenario: Ignored scenario
                Given vitest-cucumber is running
                Then  I am ignored
    ~~~

    An example, ignore Rule with `@another-tag` : 

    ~~~typescript
    describeFeature(feautre, () => {
        // ...
    }, { excludeTags : ['another-tag']}) // you can use many tags
    ~~~

    This will ignore `Rule` and its `Scenario` / `Scenario Outline`.
