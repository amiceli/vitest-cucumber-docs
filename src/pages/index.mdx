	# About vitest-cucumber

    [vitest-cucumber](https://github.com/amiceli/vitest-cucumber) is an **opiniated** tool 
    to write acceptance tests following the Gherkin syntax,
    designed to be used specifically with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

    This package was originally inspirated by [jest-cucumber](https://github.com/bencompton/jest-cucumber).

    ## Example

    A Gherkin `Feature` is written in a `.feature` file. Example: 

    ~~~gherkin
    # example.feature
    Feature: use vitest-cucumber with vitest
        Scenario: Run unit tests
            Given I have installed vitest-cucumber
            And   I have a feature like "example.feature"
            When  I run vitest-cucumber
            Then  My feature file is parsed
            And   I can test my scenarios
    ~~~

    You can then use it with **vitest-cucumber**: 

    ~~~ts
    // example-feature.spec.ts
    import { loadFeature, describeFeature } from '@amiceli/vitest-cucumber'

    const feature = await loadFeature('./example.feature')

    describeFeature(feature, ({ Scenario }) => {
        Scenario('Run unit tests', ({ Given, When, Then, And }) => {
            Given('I have installed vitest-cucumber', () => {})
            And('I have a feature like "example.feature"', () => {})
            When('I run vitest-cucumber', () => {})
            Then('My feature file is parsed', () => {})
            And('I can test my scenarios', () => {})
        })
    })
    ~~~
